# This script takes in a language as a command line argument. It then
# connects to redis, assuming that the morning/night scripts and the
# count scripts have been run (see README for use). It then tracks
# the entropy of the system and the probability of receiving a good morning
# or goodnight tweet for the specified language. It will send a tweet
# to my account of any of these values are unusually high.
